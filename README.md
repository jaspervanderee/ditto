**The privacy-first, 100% local transcript ripper.** Ditto is a Chrome Extension designed for those who value knowledge without the "data tax." It extracts transcripts from YouTube and major course platforms (Circle, Teachable, Kajabi) instantly, processing everything on your machine. No cloud, no AI hallucinations, no data harvesting.

---

## 🛠 The Problem & The Solution

Most "transcript generators" today are slow AI wrappers that require you to log in, pay a subscription, and send your data to a remote server.

**Ditto is different.** Built on the **Bitcoin Ethos** of transparency and sovereignty, Ditto doesn't "generate" text—it **reveals** it. Using a custom heuristic engine, it unlocks the data already present in your browser session and puts it on your clipboard in one click.

### Key Features:

* **One-Click Rip:** Click the icon, and the transcript is on your clipboard.
* **Universal Discovery:** Smart detection for "Show Transcript" buttons on generic course sites.
* **Privacy-First:** Manifest V3 with minimal permissions. No background scripts, no external API calls.
* **Zero Bloat:** Lightweight, fast, and designed to stay out of your way.

## 🎨 The Philosophy: Why "Ditto"?

We rejected the boring, literal names of our competitors. We chose **Ditto** because it tells a story of instant, informal agreement and effortless duplication.

* **The Name:** Short, positive, and a nod to the old-school spirit duplicators used for decentralized zine-making.
* **The Design:** Based on the color theories of Johannes Itten and Josef Albers.
* **Yellow:** Represents knowledge and the act of "shining a light" on hidden data.
* **Deep Blue:** Represents the vault of privacy and reliability.


* **The Logo:** A hybrid of the standard "Copy" icon, and the letter "D."
